1. Summary

a. Verdict
I have found a complete solution. The result is the multivariate Delta method: under the given assumptions,
$$
\sqrt{n}\,\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}\big(0,\, G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\big),
$$
where $G = Dg(\theta_0) \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times p}$ is the Jacobian of $g$ at $\theta_0$ and $\Sigma \in \mathbb{R}^{p\times p}$ is the (positive semidefinite) limit covariance of $\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0)$.

b. Method Sketch
- Apply a first-order Taylor expansion of $g$ at $\theta_0$ around the estimator $\hat\theta_n$:
  $$
  g(\hat\theta_n) = g(\theta_0) + G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + R_n,
  $$
  where the remainder $R_n$ satisfies
  $$
  \|R_n\| = o_p\big(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|\big).
  $$
- Use the assumed convergence
  $$
  \sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma),
  $$
  together with the mean-value-type remainder control to show that
  $$
  \sqrt{n}\,R_n = o_p(1).
  $$
- Therefore,
  $$
  \sqrt{n}\,\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big)
  = G\,\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + \sqrt{n}\,R_n
  \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}\big(0,\, G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\big)
  $$
  by Slutsky’s theorem, since $G\,\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0, G\Sigma G^\top)$ and $\sqrt{n}R_n \xrightarrow{p} 0$.

Key lemmas:
- Multivariate Taylor expansion with remainder: for $\hat\theta_n$ near $\theta_0$,
  $$
  g(\hat\theta_n) = g(\theta_0) + G(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + R_n,
  $$
  with $R_n = o(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|)$.
- If $\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} N(0,\Sigma)$ and $\sqrt{n}\,R_n \to_p 0$, Slutsky yields the claimed limit.

2. Detailed Solution

<<<BEGIN DETAILED SOLUTION>>>

Let $\hat\theta_n \in \mathbb{R}^p$ satisfy
$\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)$,
with $\Sigma$ positive semidefinite, and let $g:\mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R}^m$ be continuously differentiable at $\theta_0$. Denote $G := Dg(\theta_0) \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times p}$.

1) Taylor expansion with remainder
Since $g$ is differentiable at $\theta_0$, for any $\hat\theta$ near $\theta_0$ there exists a mean-value representation
$$
g(\hat\theta) = g(\theta_0) + G(\hat\theta - \theta_0) + R(\hat\theta),
$$
where $R(\hat\theta)$ satisfies
$$
\lim_{\hat\theta \to \theta_0} \frac{\|R(\hat\theta)\|}{\|\hat\theta - \theta_0\|} = 0.
$$
Equivalently, the remainder satisfies
$$
R(\hat\theta) = o(\hat\theta - \theta_0).
$$
Applying this to $\hat\theta_n$ gives
$$
g(\hat\theta_n) = g(\theta_0) + G(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + R_n,
$$
with
$$
R_n := R(\hat\theta_n) = o\big(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\big).
$$

2) Normalizing by $\sqrt{n}$
Subtract $g(\theta_0)$ and multiply by $\sqrt{n}$:
$$
\sqrt{n}\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big)
= G\,\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + \sqrt{n}\,R_n.
$$

3) Behavior of the linear term
By assumption,
$$
\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma),
$$
hence by the continuous mapping theorem and linearity,
$$
G\,\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} GZ \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\, G\Sigma G^\top).
$$

4) Remainder term vanishes in probability after scaling
From $R_n = o(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|)$, and the fact that $\hat\theta_n \to \theta_0$ in probability (indeed, $\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0)$ is tight), we have
$$
\frac{\|R_n\|}{\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|} \xrightarrow{p} 0.
$$
Also, $\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| = O_p(n^{-1/2})$ because its product with $\sqrt{n}$ is tight. Therefore
$$
\sqrt{n}\,\|R_n\| = \left(\frac{\|R_n\|}{\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|}\right)\cdot \|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|\cdot \sqrt{n} = o_p(1).
$$
Thus
$$
\sqrt{n}\,R_n \xrightarrow{p} 0.
$$

5) Conclusion by Slutsky
Since $\sqrt{n}\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big)
= G\,\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + \sqrt{n}\,R_n$, and the first term converges in distribution to $\mathcal{N}(0, G\Sigma G^\top)$ while the second term converges in probability to $0$, Slutsky’s theorem yields
$$
\sqrt{n}\,\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}\big(0,\, G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\big).
$$

This proves the multivariate Delta method in the stated form. ∎

1. Summary

a. Verdict
I have found a complete solution. The multivariate Delta method holds under the stated assumptions: if $\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)$ with $\Sigma$ positive semidefinite and $g:\mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R}^m$ is continuously differentiable at $\theta_0$ with Jacobian $G = Dg(\theta_0)$, then
$$
\sqrt{n}\,\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}\big(0,\, G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\big).
$$

b. Method Sketch
- Perform a first-order Taylor expansion of $g$ at $\theta_0$ around $\hat\theta_n$ (or equivalently expand around $\theta_0$):
  $$
  g(\hat\theta_n) = g(\theta_0) + G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + R_n,
  $$
  where the remainder satisfies $R_n = o(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|)$ as $\hat\theta_n \to \theta_0$.
- Use the given weak convergence of $\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0)$ and Slutsky's theorem. Specifically,
  - $G\,\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0, G\Sigma G^\top)$.
  - $\sqrt{n}\,R_n = o_p(1)$ because $\|R_n\| = o(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|)$ and $\sqrt{n}\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| = O_p(1)$.
- Conclude the claimed limit via Slutsky’s theorem.

Key lemmas:
- Multivariate Taylor expansion with remainder: for $\hat\theta$ near $\theta_0$,
  $$
  g(\hat\theta) = g(\theta_0) + G(\hat\theta - \theta_0) + R(\hat\theta),
  $$
  with $R(\hat\theta) = o(\|\hat\theta - \theta_0\|)$.
- If $\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)$ and $\sqrt{n}R_n \xrightarrow{p} 0$, then
  $$
  \sqrt{n}\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0, G\Sigma G^\top).
  $$

2. Detailed Solution

<<<BEGIN DETAILED SOLUTION>>>

Let $\hat\theta_n \in \mathbb{R}^p$ satisfy
$\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)$,
with $\Sigma$ positive semidefinite, and let $g:\mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R}^m$ be continuously differentiable at $\theta_0$. Denote $G := Dg(\theta_0) \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times p}$.

1) Taylor expansion with remainder
Since $g$ is differentiable at $\theta_0$ with derivative $G$, there exists a remainder representation (mean value form or Fréchet differentiability) such that for $\hat\theta$ near $\theta_0$,
$$
g(\hat\theta) = g(\theta_0) + G(\hat\theta - \theta_0) + R(\hat\theta),
$$
where
$$
\lim_{\hat\theta \to \theta_0} \frac{\|R(\hat\theta)\|}{\|\hat\theta - \theta_0\|} = 0.
$$
Equivalently,
$$
R(\hat\theta) = o(\|\hat\theta - \theta_0\|).
$$

Applying this to $\hat\theta_n$ yields
$$
g(\hat\theta_n) = g(\theta_0) + G(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + R_n,
$$
with
$$
R_n := R(\hat\theta_n) = o\big(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\big).
$$

2) Normalizing by $\sqrt{n}$
Subtract $g(\theta_0)$ and multiply by $\sqrt{n}$:
$$
\sqrt{n}\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big)
= G\,\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + \sqrt{n}\,R_n.
$$

3) Behavior of the linear term
By assumption,
$$
\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma),
$$
hence
$$
G\,\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} GZ \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\, G\Sigma G^\top).
$$

4) Remainder term vanishes after scaling
From $R_n = o(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|)$ and the tightness of $\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0)$, we have
$$
\frac{\|R_n\|}{\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|} \xrightarrow{p} 0.
$$
Since $\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| = O_p(n^{-1/2})$ (because $\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0)$ is tight), it follows that
$$
\sqrt{n}\,\|R_n\| = \left(\frac{\|R_n\|}{\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|}\right)\cdot \|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|\cdot \sqrt{n} = o_p(1).
$$
Therefore
$$
\sqrt{n}\,R_n \xrightarrow{p} 0.
$$

5) Conclusion by Slutsky
Thus
$$
\sqrt{n}\,\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big)
= G\,\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + \sqrt{n}\,R_n,
$$
where the first term converges in distribution to $\mathcal{N}(0, G\Sigma G^\top)$ and the second term converges in probability to $0$. By Slutsky’s theorem,
$$
\sqrt{n}\,\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big)
\xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}\big(0,\, G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\big).
$$

This completes the proof of the multivariate Delta method in the stated form. ∎

Summary
Final Verdict: The solution is correct.
List of Findings:
- Location: The solution performs a standard Taylor expansion with remainder and uses the o(‖h‖) remainder, then applies Slutsky’s theorem. There are no substantive gaps or incorrect claims in these steps.

Detailed Verification Log
<<<BEGIN LOG>>>

We analyze the solution step by step and justify each assertion, or identify gaps if present.

1) Taylor expansion with remainder
Statement:
“Since g is differentiable at θ0 with derivative G, there exists a remainder representation (mean value form or Fréchet differentiability) such that for θ near θ0,
g(θ) = g(θ0) + G(θ − θ0) + R(θ),
where
lim_{θ→θ0} ||R(θ)|| / ||θ − θ0|| = 0.
Equivalently,
R(θ) = o(‖θ − θ0‖).”

Assessment:
- This is precisely the standard definition of differentiability (Frechet differentiability) of g at θ0: there exists a linear map G such that g(θ) = g(θ0) + G(θ − θ0) + o(‖θ − θ0‖) as θ → θ0. The presented notation and equivalence are correct.
- No issue identified here.

2) Applying to θ̂n
Statement:
“Applying this to θ̂n yields
g(θ̂n) = g(θ0) + G(θ̂n − θ0) + Rn,
with
Rn := R(θ̂n) = o(θ̂n − θ0).”

Assessment:
- This is a direct substitution of θ = θ̂n into the remainder form. The definition Rn = o(‖θ̂n − θ0‖) is consistent with the previous step.
- The statement is correct.

3) Normalizing by √n
Statement:
“Subtract g(θ0) and multiply by √n:
√n (g(θ̂n) − g(θ0)) = G √n(θ̂n − θ0) + √n Rn.”

Assessment:
- Linearizes the expression and correctly splits into the linear term and the scaled remainder.
- This step is correct.

4) Behavior of the linear term
Statement:
“By assumption,
√n(θ̂n − θ0) ⇒ Z ∼ N(0, Σ),
hence
G √n(θ̂n − θ0) ⇒ GZ ∼ N(0, G Σ G^T).”

Assessment:
- This uses the given asymptotic distribution of √n(θ̂n − θ0) and linear transformation of a normal vector. Since G is a fixed matrix, the linear transformation GZ is Gaussian with mean 0 and covariance G Σ G^T. This is correct.
- Step is valid.

5) Remainder term vanishes after scaling
Statement:
“From Rn = o(‖θ̂n − θ0‖) and the tightness of √n(θ̂n − θ0), we have
‖Rn‖ / ‖θ̂n − θ0‖ → 0 in probability.
Since ‖θ̂n − θ0‖ = O_p(n^{-1/2}) (because √n(θ̂n − θ0) is tight), it follows that
√n ‖Rn‖ = (‖Rn‖ / ‖θ̂n − θ0‖) · ‖θ̂n − θ0‖ · √n = o_p(1).
Therefore
√n Rn ⇒ 0 in probability.”

Assessment:
- The core claim is that Rn = o(‖θ̂n − θ0‖) implies √n Rn = o_p(1). Indeed, since ‖θ̂n − θ0‖ = o_p(n^{-1/2}) is not exactly stated; rather we know √n(θ̂n − θ0) is tight, which implies ‖θ̂n − θ0‖ = O_p(n^{-1/2}). The ratio ‖Rn‖/‖θ̂n − θ0‖ → 0 in probability expresses o_p(‖θ̂n − θ0‖). Multiplying by √n yields √n‖Rn‖ = (‖Rn‖/‖θ̂n − θ0‖) · ‖θ̂n − θ0‖ · √n. Since (‖Rn‖/‖θ̂n − θ0‖) → 0 in probability and ‖θ̂n − θ0‖ · √n = ‖√n(θ̂n − θ0)‖ is tight (hence O_p(1)), the product is o_p(1).
- The presented argument mirrors the standard reasoning in Delta-method proofs: o_p of the norm of the estimation error, combined with the O_p or tightness of the scaled error, yields o_p(1) for the scaled remainder.
- While the phrasing “tightness of √n(θ̂n − θ0)” leading to ‖θ̂n − θ0‖ = O_p(n^{-1/2}) is acceptable, the logical chain is valid. There is no hidden inconsistency detected here.
- Therefore this step is correct, albeit one might more succinctly appeal to the standard Delta-method remainder argument.

6) Conclusion by Slutsky
Statement:
“Thus
√n (g(θ̂n) − g(θ0)) = G √n(θ̂n − θ0) + √n Rn,
where the first term converges in distribution to N(0, G Σ G^T) and the second term converges in probability to 0. By Slutsky’s theorem,
√n (g(θ̂n) − g(θ0)) ⇒ N(0, G Σ G^T).”

Assessment:
- This is a direct application of Slutsky’s theorem: if Xn ⇒ X in distribution and Yn ⇒ c in probability, then Xn + Yn ⇒ X + c. With c = 0, the result remains N(0, G Σ G^T). Correct.
- Step is correct.

Overall assessment:
- All steps are valid, and the argument is rigorous for the multivariate Delta method under the stated regularity assumptions.

Conclusion:
- The solution is correct. No Critical Errors or Justification Gaps detected in the reasoning. The remainder term handling is standard for the Delta method, and the Slutsky step is applied correctly.

Summary
Final Verdict: The solution is correct.

List of Findings:
- Location: The solution follows the standard Taylor expansion with remainder for differentiable g and uses the o(||hatθ_n − θ0||) remainder to deduce that √n R_n = o_p(1). This is a standard justification in the Delta method and, given the assumptions (Fréchet differentiability at θ0 and tightness of √n(hatθ_n − θ0)), the argument is rigorous. No substantive issues detected.

<<<BEGIN LOG###
Detailed Verification Log

We verify the solution step by step, quoting the corresponding text and assessing its rigor and connections.

Step 1: Taylor expansion with remainder
Text: “Since g is differentiable at θ0 with derivative G, there exists a remainder representation (mean value form or Fréchet differentiability) such that for hatθ near θ0,
g(hatθ) = g(θ0) + G(hatθ − θ0) + R(hatθ),
where
lim_{hatθ → θ0} ||R(hatθ)|| / ||hatθ − θ0|| = 0.
Equivalently,
R(hatθ) = o(||hatθ − θ0||).”

Assessment:
- This is the standard form of differentiability: g is differentiable at θ0 with derivative G implies the existence of a remainder R(hatθ) such that g(hatθ) = g(θ0) + G(hatθ − θ0) + o(||hatθ − θ0||). The statement is correct provided the notion of differentiability used is Fréchet differentiability (which is implied by “continuously differentiable” at θ0 in many texts, and the problem states continuously differentiable).
- The equivalence to R(hatθ) = o(||hatθ − θ0||) is correct.
- No gap detected here.

Step 2: Applying to hatθ_n
Text: “Applying this to hatθ_n yields
g(hatθ_n) = g(θ0) + G(hatθ_n − θ0) + R_n,
with
R_n := R(hatθ_n) = o(||hatθ_n − θ0||).”

Assessment:
- Direct substitution is valid. The definition R_n = R(hatθ_n) with the same o(||·||) characterization is correct.
- No issue.

Step 3: Normalizing by √n
Text: “Subtract g(θ0) and multiply by √n:
√n(g(hatθ_n) − g(θ0)) = G √n(hatθ_n − θ0) + √n R_n.”

Assessment:
- Algebra is correct. This is a straightforward consequence of the previous line.
- No issue.

Step 4: Behavior of the linear term
Text: “By assumption,
√n(hatθ_n − θ0) ⇒ Z ∼ N(0, Σ),
hence
G √n(hatθ_n − θ0) ⇒ GZ ∼ N(0, G Σ G^T).”

Assessment:
- Linear transformation of a convergent in distribution random vector preserves convergence, with the covariance transformed by G. This is standard: if X_n ⇒ X and G is deterministic, then GX_n ⇒ GX and Cov(GX) = G Cov(X) G^T. The statement about the limit being N(0, G Σ G^T) is correct.
- No issue.

Step 5: Remainder term vanishes after scaling
Text: “From R_n = o(||hatθ_n − θ0||) and the tightness of √n(hatθ_n − θ0), we have
||R_n|| / ||hatθ_n − θ0|| →p 0.
Since ||hatθ_n − θ0|| = O_p(n^−1/2) (because √n(hatθ_n − θ0) is tight), it follows that
√n ||R_n|| = (||R_n|| / ||hatθ_n − θ0||) · ||hatθ_n − θ0|| · √n = o_p(1).
Therefore
√n R_n ⇒ 0 in probability.”

Assessment:
- The statement R_n = o(||hatθ_n − θ0||) implies (||R_n|| / ||hatθ_n − θ0||) →p 0 provided the denominator is nonzero with high probability. This is standard: if X_n = o_p(a_n) and a_n → 0 in probability, then X_n / a_n →p 0. Here a_n = ||hatθ_n − θ0||.
- They invoke tightness of √n(hatθ_n − θ0) to claim ||hatθ_n − θ0|| = O_p(n^−1/2). This is valid: convergence in distribution of √n(hatθ_n − θ0) to a nondegenerate limit implies the sequence is tight and bounded in probability, which yields the O_p(n^−1/2) rate for ||hatθ_n − θ0||.
- The algebraic manipulation: √n R_n = (||R_n|| / ||hatθ_n − θ0||) · ||hatθ_n − θ0|| · √n, and the first factor tends to 0 in probability, the second factor is O_p(n^−1/2) times √n? Careful: ||hatθ_n − θ0|| is O_p(n^−1/2); multiplying by √n yields O_p(1). The product o_p(1) · O_p(1) is o_p(1). Hence √n R_n ⇒ 0 in probability. The justification is acceptable, though one could present it with standard Slutsky-type argument.
- Overall, this step is rigorous enough given standard regularity and the stated assumptions. No critical gap is present.

Step 6: Conclusion by Slutsky
Text: “Thus
√n(g(hatθ_n) − g(θ0)) = G √n(hatθ_n − θ0) + √n R_n,
where the first term converges in distribution to N(0, G Σ G^T) and the second term converges in probability to 0. By Slutsky’s theorem,
√n(g(hatθ_n) − g(θ0)) ⇒ N(0, G Σ G^T).”

Assessment:
- This is the standard Slutsky argument: a sum of a convergent-in-distribution term and a term converging to 0 in probability converges to the same limit as the first term. The result matches the multivariate Delta method.
- No issue.

Overall assessment:
- All steps are consistent with the multivariate Delta method under the stated assumptions. The remainder justification in Step 4 is adequately handled using o_p arguments and tightness. There are no logical gaps that would render the argument invalid, and no critical errors are present.

Conclusion:
- The solution is correct. It establishes the asymptotic distribution √n (g( hatθ_n ) − g(θ0)) ∼ N(0, G Σ G^T) via the standard Delta method argument.

Summary
Final Verdict: The solution is correct (under the standard regularity assumptions typically invoked for the multivariate Delta method).

List of Findings:
- Location: "Taylor expansion with remainder ... there exists a remainder representation (mean value form or Fréchet differentiability) ... R(\hat\theta) = o(\|\hat\theta - \theta_0\|)."
  Issue: Justification Gap — The argument relies on a Taylor expansion with a remainder in the multivariate setting. The solution invokes a remainder R(\hat\theta) with o(||\hat\theta - \theta_0||) under the premise that g is continuously differentiable at \theta_0. While standard in many texts, the precise justification typically requires g to be differentiable in a neighborhood of \theta_0 (i.e., Fréchet differentiable or differentiable with a continuously varying derivative in a neighborhood). The statement as given may be acceptable under the usual interpretation, but strictly one should verify the needed differentiability (not merely differentiability at the point) to guarantee the remainder form used.
- Location: "R_n := R(\hat\theta_n) = o(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0)."
  Issue: Justification Gap — This uses O-notation in a vector form. The customary precise statement is ||R(\hat\theta_n)|| = o(||\hat\theta_n - \theta_0||). The solution writes the scalar o on the norm, which is acceptable if interpreted properly; otherwise one would need to keep track of vector norms explicitly. No essential logical gap, but requires careful interpretation of the remainder in norm form.
- Location: "From R_n = o(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|) and the tightness of \sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0), we have \frac{\|R_n\|}{\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|} \xrightarrow{p} 0."
  Issue: Justification Gap — The standard argument uses the definition of o(\cdot) in the deterministic sense to claim the ratio tends to 0 in probability when evaluated at a sequence with a known stochastic rate. The step is plausible, but it presumes a uniformity or a stochastic version of little-o, which typically follows from the fact that R(\cdot) = o(\cdot) as \hat\theta \to \theta_0 and that \hat\theta_n \to_p \theta_0 at rate n^{-1/2}. A more careful justification would spell out the probabilistic convergence of the ratio, but the conclusion is standard and correct under the usual interpretation.
- Location: "Since \|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| = O_p(n^{-1/2}) (because \sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) is tight)..."
  Issue: Minor clarification — Tightness of \sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) implies the sequence is bounded in probability, which indeed yields \|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| = O_p(n^{-1/2}). This is a standard consequence; no issue with the claim itself.
- Location: "By Slutsky’s theorem, ..."
  Issue: None — This is the standard concluding step in the Delta method.

Detailed Verification Log
<<<BEGIN LOG>>>

Step 0: Restatement of setup
Quoted text: 
"Let \hat\theta_n \in \mathbb{R}^p satisfy
\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma),
with \Sigma positive semidefinite, and let g:\mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R}^m be continuously differentiable at \theta_0. Denote G := Dg(\theta_0) \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times p}."

Analysis: This is the standard Delta-method setup. The assumption of asymptotic normality of the scaled estimator and differentiability of g at \theta_0 with Jacobian G is correct. No issues.

Step 1: Taylor expansion with remainder
Quoted text:
"Since g is differentiable at \theta_0 with derivative G, there exists a remainder representation (mean value form or Fréchet differentiability) such that for \hat\theta near \theta_0,
g(\hat\theta) = g(\theta_0) + G(\hat\theta - \theta_0) + R(\hat\theta),
where
\lim_{\hat\theta \to \theta_0} \frac{\|R(\hat\theta)\|}{\|\hat\theta - \theta_0\|} = 0.
Equivalently,
R(\hat\theta) = o(\|\hat\theta - \theta_0\|)."

Analysis: This is the standard first-order Taylor expansion with a remainder in norm form. The justification requires g to be differentiable at \theta_0 and, typically, that the derivative is continuous in a neighborhood (to ensure the remainder is little-o). The text states "g is continuously differentiable at \theta_0," which is intended to ensure the remainder property. In some formulations, differentiability at the point alone suffices to obtain a first-order linear approximation with a remainder little-o of the norm, but to be safe, one normally requires Fréchet differentiability in a neighborhood. This step is acceptable under standard regularity assumptions; potential minor ambiguity is noted here as a justification gap depending on interpretation of "continuously differentiable at \theta_0." No critical error, but a caveat.

Step 2: Apply to \hat\theta_n
Quoted text:
"Applying this to \hat\theta_n yields
g(\hat\theta_n) = g(\theta_0) + G(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + R_n,
with
R_n := R(\hat\theta_n) = o(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0)."

Analysis: Direct substitution. The notation of o(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) is interpreted as a vector-o of the vector. By norm, this means ||R_n|| = o(||\hat\theta_n - \theta_0||). This step is consistent with Step 1. No issue.

Step 3: Normalize by \sqrt{n}
Quoted text:
"Subtract g(\theta_0) and multiply by \sqrt{n}:
\sqrt{n}(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0))
= G\,\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + \sqrt{n}\,R_n."

Analysis: Straightforward linearization and scaling. Correct.

Step 4: Behavior of the linear term
Quoted text:
"By assumption,
\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma),
hence
G\,\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} GZ \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\, G\Sigma G^\top)."

Analysis: This uses the continuous mapping theorem for linear transformation of a multivariate normal limit. Correct.

Step 5: Remainder term vanishes after scaling
Quoted text:
"From R_n = o(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|) and the tightness of \sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0), we have
\frac{\|R_n\|}{\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|} \xrightarrow{p} 0.
Since \|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| = O_p(n^{-1/2}) (because \sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) is tight), it follows that
\sqrt{n}\,\|R_n\| = \left(\frac{\|R_n\|}{\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|}\right)\cdot \|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|\cdot \sqrt{n} = o_p(1)."

Analysis: The argument is a standard probabilistic little-o transfer. It uses:

- ||R_n|| = o(||\hat\theta_n - \theta_0||), which means the ratio goes to 0 in probability if the denominator does not vanish too fast. Since ||\hat\theta_n - \theta_0|| = O_p(n^{-1/2}), multiplying by sqrt{n} yields a term that is O_p(1). The product with a ratio that goes to 0 in probability yields o_p(1). The logic is sound, though one could present more formal steps; as stated, it is acceptable.

Step 6: Slutsky
Quoted text:
"Thus
\sqrt{n}\,\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big)
= G\,\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + \sqrt{n}\,R_n,
where the first term converges in distribution to \mathcal{N}(0, G\Sigma G^\top) and the second term converges in probability to 0. By Slutsky’s theorem,
\sqrt{n}\,\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big)
\xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,\, G\,\Sigma\,G^\top)."

Analysis: Standard application of Slutsky's theorem. Correct.

Conclusion
The solution follows the standard multivariate Delta method logic. The main potential concerns are minor justification gaps around the exact regularity needed for the remainder term (Step 1) and the precise handling of o(\cdot) in a stochastic setting (Step 4). However, under the common regularity assumptions (g differentiable with derivative continuous in a neighborhood, and R(\hat\theta) = o(||\hat\theta- \theta_0||) in a way compatible with the stochastic convergence), the argument is complete and correct.

Summary
Final Verdict: The solution is correct.
List of Findings:
- Location: The entire derivation follows the standard Delta-method argument and, upon inspection, contains no identifiable Critical Errors or unjustified gaps that would invalidate the proof. All steps can be justified given the standard assumptions (Fréchet differentiability of g at θ0, and the asymptotic normality of √n(θ̂n − θ0)).

<<<BEGIN LOG>>>
 Detailed Verification Log

We verify the solution step by step, quoting the relevant text and assessing each step.

1) Statement of setup (as given in the problem)
- Text: “Let {θ̂n} be a sequence with √n(θ̂n − θ0) ⇒d N(0, Σ)… g: R^p → R^m continuously differentiable at θ0, and G := Dg(θ0).”
- Assessment: This matches the stated Delta-method framework. The condition that g is continuously differentiable at θ0 ensures the existence of a Jacobian G = Dg(θ0). No issue.

2) Step 1: “Taylor expansion with remainder”
- Text: “Since g is differentiable at θ0 with derivative G, there exists a remainder representation (mean value form or Fréchet differentiability) such that for θ̂ near θ0, g(θ̂) = g(θ0) + G(θ̂ − θ0) + R(θ̂), where lim_{θ̂→θ0} ||R(θ̂)|| / ||θ̂ − θ0|| = 0. Equivalently, R(θ̂) = o(||θ̂ − θ0||).”
- Assessment: This is a standard expression of differentiability at θ0 in terms of a first-order expansion with a remainder that's o of the perturbation. It is consistent with Fréchet differentiability. The claim is valid under the assumption that g is differentiable at θ0 (which is given to be true via “continuously differentiable at θ0”). No issue.

3) Substitution of θ̂ with θ̂n
- Text: “Applying this to θ̂n yields g(θ̂n) = g(θ0) + G(θ̂n − θ0) + Rn, with Rn := R(θ̂n) = o(||θ̂n − θ0||).”
- Assessment: This is a direct substitution. The remainder term Rn inherits the o(||·||) behavior evaluated at θ̂n. This is correct given the previous step. No issue.

4) Step 2: “Normalizing by √n”
- Text: “Subtract g(θ0) and multiply by √n:
√n(g(θ̂n) − g(θ0)) = G√n(θ̂n − θ0) + √n Rn.”
- Assessment: Algebraic manipulation is correct. No issue.

5) Step 3: “Behavior of the linear term”
- Text: “By assumption, √n(θ̂n − θ0) ⇒d Z ∼ N(0, Σ), hence G√n(θ̂n − θ0) ⇒d GZ ∼ N(0, GΣG^T).”
- Assessment: The continuous linear transformation of a normal vector yields a normal with covariance GΣG^T. Convergence in distribution is preserved under linear maps. No issue.

6) Step 4: “Remainder term vanishes after scaling”
- Text: “From Rn = o(||θ̂n − θ0||) and the tightness of √n(θ̂n − θ0), we have ||Rn|| / ||θ̂n − θ0|| →p 0. Since ||θ̂n − θ0|| = O_p(n^{-1/2}) (because √n(θ̂n − θ0) is tight), it follows that √n ||Rn|| = (||Rn|| / ||θ̂n − θ0||) · ||θ̂n − θ0|| · √n = o_p(1). Therefore √n Rn ⇒p 0.”
- Assessment:
  - The statement Rn = o(||θ̂n − θ0||) implies the ratio ||Rn|| / ||θ̂n − θ0|| → 0 as θ̂n → θ0 in the deterministic setting. Replacing θ̂ with the random sequence θ̂n, the standard probabilistic extension asserts that if h_n →p 0 and r(h) = o(||h||) as h → 0, then r(h_n) = o_p(||h_n||). The solution’s claim aligns with this standard result.
  - The claim that ||θ̂n − θ0|| = O_p(n^{-1/2}) follows from √n(θ̂n − θ0) being tight (indeed it converges in distribution to a fixed distribution), which implies that ||θ̂n − θ0|| = O_p(n^{-1/2}).
  - The chained expression √n||Rn|| = (||Rn||/||h_n||) · ||h_n|| · √n is correctly manipulated to conclude o_p(1). The key justification rests on the o(||h||) behavior and the O_p(n^{-1/2}) rate of h_n. The combination yields √n Rn = o_p(1). No issue, provided the standard delta-method regularity conditions hold (which they do given differentiability at θ0).

7) Step 5: “Conclusion by Slutsky”
- Text: “Thus √n(g(θ̂n) − g(θ0)) = G√n(θ̂n − θ0) + √n Rn, where the first term converges to N(0, GΣG^T) and the second term converges in probability to 0. By Slutsky’s theorem, √n(g(θ̂n) − g(θ0)) ⇒d N(0, GΣG^T).”
- Assessment: Slutsky’s theorem applies since a sequence converging in distribution plus an independent or not necessarily independent sequence converging in probability to 0 yields a sum converging in distribution to the limit of the first term. Here G√n(θ̂n − θ0) converges to N(0, GΣG^T) and √n Rn ⇒p 0, hence the sum converges to the same normal. The logic is standard and valid. No issue.

Conclusion
- The solution provides a standard and rigorous Delta-method argument for the multivariate case. All steps are justified under the stated differentiability and asymptotic normality assumptions. No Critical Errors or unjustified gaps were found.

Detailed Verification Log
<<<BEGIN LOG>>>
Step 1: "Taylor expansion with remainder
Since $g$ is differentiable at $\theta_0$ with derivative $G$, there exists a remainder representation (mean value form or Fréchet differentiability) such that for $\hat\theta$ near $\theta_0$,
$$
g(\hat\theta) = g(\theta_0) + G(\hat\theta - \theta_0) + R(\hat\theta),
$$
where
$$
\lim_{\hat\theta \to \theta_0} \frac{\|R(\hat\theta)\|}{\|\hat\theta - \theta_0\|} = 0.
$$
Equivalently,
$$
R(\hat\theta) = o(\|\hat\theta - \theta_0\|).
$$

Applying this to $\hat\theta_n$ yields
$$
g(\hat\theta_n) = g(\theta_0) + G(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + R_n,
$$
with
$$
R_n := R(\hat\theta_n) = o\big(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\big).
$$"

Justification: This is the standard Taylor expansion with remainder for a function differentiable at θ0. Using Fréchet differentiability (which follows from continuous differentiability) yields the remainder term R that is o of the increment. The notation is consistent: R_n = o(‖\hatθ_n - θ0‖). This step is correct under the given smoothness assumptions.

Step 2: "Normalizing by $\sqrt{n}$
Subtract $g(\theta_0)$ and multiply by $\sqrt{n}$:
$$
\sqrt{n}\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big)
= G\,\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + \sqrt{n}\,R_n.
$$"

Justification: Substituting the expansion into the left-hand side and distributing the scalar yields the stated decomposition. This step is algebraically and functionally correct.

Step 3: "Behavior of the linear term
By assumption,
$$
\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma),
$$
hence
$$
G\,\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} GZ \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\, G\Sigma G^\top).
$$"

Justification: Linear transformation of a multivariate normal vector yields a multivariate normal with the transformed covariance. Convergence in distribution is preserved under continuous linear maps. This step is correct.

Step 4: "Remainder term vanishes after scaling
From $R_n = o(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|)$ and the tightness of $\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0)$, we have
$$
\frac{\|R_n\|}{\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|} \xrightarrow{p} 0.
$$
Since $\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| = O_p(n^{-1/2})$ (because $\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0)$ is tight), it follows that
$$
\sqrt{n}\,\|R_n\| = \left(\frac{\|R_n\|}{\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|}\right)\cdot \|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|\cdot \sqrt{n} = o_p(1).
$$
Therefore
$$
\sqrt{n}\,R_n \xrightarrow{p} 0.
$$"

Justification: The standard argument uses o-notation and the fact that a ratio going to 0 in probability times a tight (O_p(1)) sequence remains o_p(1). The bound ||\hatθ_n - θ0|| = O_p(n^{-1/2}) is equivalent to the tightness of √n(\hatθ_n - θ0). The conclusion that √n R_n →p 0 is correct. This step is rigorous given the stated o() condition and standard probabilistic convergence facts.

Step 5: "Conclusion by Slutsky
Thus
$$
\sqrt{n}\,\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big)
= G\,\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + \sqrt{n}\,R_n,
$$
where the first term converges in distribution to $\mathcal{N}(0, G\Sigma G^\top)$ and the second term converges in probability to $0$. By Slutsky’s theorem,
$$
\sqrt{n}\,\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big)
\xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}\big(0,\, G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\big).
$$"

Justification: Slutsky’s theorem applies since one part converges in distribution to a non-degenerate normal and the remainder term vanishes in probability. This yields the claimed asymptotic distribution. This step is correct.

Overall Assessment: All steps are logically justified under the stated differentiability and convergence assumptions. There are no critical gaps or incorrect conclusions. The argument is a standard and rigorous multivariate Delta Method proof.
