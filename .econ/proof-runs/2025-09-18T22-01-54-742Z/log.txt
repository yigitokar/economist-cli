1. Summary

a. Verdict: I have found a complete solution. The result holds:
$$
\sqrt{n}\,\Big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\Big) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}\big(0,\ G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\big),
$$
where \(G = Dg(\theta_0)\).

b. Method Sketch:
- Start from a first-order Taylor expansion of \(g\) at \(\theta_0\):
  \[
  g(\hat\theta_n) = g(\theta_0) + G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + R_n,
  \]
  where \(R_n\) is the remainder term.
- By differentiability of \(g\) at \(\theta_0\), the remainder satisfies
  \[
  \frac{R_n}{\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|} \to 0 \quad \text{as } \hat\theta_n \to \theta_0.
  \]
- Since \(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} N(0,\Sigma)\), we have \(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0 = O_p(n^{-1/2})\). Therefore
  \[
  \sqrt{n} R_n = o_p(1).
  \]
- Thus
  \[
  \sqrt{n}\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big)
  = G\,\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + o_p(1),
  \]
  and Slutsky’s theorem yields the claimed multivariate normal limit with covariance \(G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\).

Key lemmas/claims:
- Taylor expansion with remainder for differentiable \(g\) at \(\theta_0\).
- Remainder term is negligible after scaling by \(\sqrt{n}\) since \(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0 = O_p(n^{-1/2})\).
- Slutsky’s theorem to combine convergence of the linear term with the vanishing remainder.

2. Detailed Solution

<<<BEGIN DETAILED SOLUTION>>>

Let \(\hat\theta_n\) be as in the setup, with
\[
\sqrt{n}\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma),
\]
where \(\Sigma \succeq 0\) is the given covariance matrix.

Let \(g:\mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R}^m\) be continuously differentiable at \(\theta_0\), and let \(G := Dg(\theta_0) \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times p}\) denote the Jacobian at \(\theta_0\). By the differentiability of \(g\) at \(\theta_0\), we have the first-order Taylor expansion with remainder:
\[
g(\hat\theta_n) = g(\theta_0) + G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + R_n,
\]
where
\[
R_n = g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0) - G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0),
\]
and the standard mean-value form of the remainder (or the differentiability-based remainder) implies
\[
\frac{R_n}{\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|} \to 0 \quad \text{as } \hat\theta_n \to \theta_0.
\]

From the assumed convergence, \(\hat\theta_n \to_p \theta_0\) (in the sense that \(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0)\) is tight and converges in distribution). Therefore
\[
\hat\theta_n - \theta_0 = O_p(n^{-1/2}),
\]
and hence
\[
\| \hat\theta_n - \theta_0 \| = O_p(n^{-1/2}).
\]
Consequently,
\[
\frac{R_n}{\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|} \xrightarrow{p} 0
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
R_n = o_p\big(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|\big) = o_p(n^{-1/2}).
\]
Multiplying by \(\sqrt{n}\) gives
\[
\sqrt{n}\,R_n = o_p(1).
\]

Now consider
\[
\sqrt{n}\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big)
= \sqrt{n}\,G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + \sqrt{n}\,R_n.
\]
By the previous step, \(\sqrt{n}\,R_n = o_p(1)\). Since \(\sqrt{n}\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)\) and \(G\) is a constant matrix, the continuous mapping theorem gives
\[
\sqrt{n}\,G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}\big(0,\, G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\big).
\]

Finally, by Slutsky's theorem, adding the negligible term \(\sqrt{n}\,R_n\) preserves the limit:
\[
\sqrt{n}\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big)
\xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}\big(0,\, G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\big).
\]

This completes the proof of the multivariate delta method under the stated hypotheses.

1. Summary

a. Verdict: I have found a complete solution. The result holds:
$$
\sqrt{n}\,\Big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\Big) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}\big(0,\ G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\big),
$$
where \(G = Dg(\theta_0)\).

b. Method Sketch:
- Apply a first-order Taylor expansion of \(g\) at \(\theta_0\):
  \[
  g(\hat\theta_n) = g(\theta_0) + G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + R_n,
  \]
  with remainder \(R_n\) satisfying \(R_n = o(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|)\) as \(\hat\theta_n \to \theta_0\) (follows from differentiability of \(g\) at \(\theta_0\)).
- Since \(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)\), we have \(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0 = O_p(n^{-1/2})\).
- Therefore \(\sqrt{n} R_n = o_p(1)\) because
  \[
  \sqrt{n} R_n = \sqrt{n}\, o_p(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|) = o_p\big(\sqrt{n}\,\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|\big) = o_p(1).
  \]
- Hence
  \[
  \sqrt{n}\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big)
  = G\,\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + o_p(1),
  \]
  and Slutsky’s theorem yields the claimed limit:
  \[
  \sqrt{n}\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}\big(0,\, G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\big).
  \]

2. Detailed Solution

<<<BEGIN DETAILED SOLUTION>>>

Let \(\hat\theta_n\) be as in the setup, with
\[
\sqrt{n}\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma),
\]
where \(\Sigma \succeq 0\).

Let \(g:\mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R}^m\) be continuously differentiable at \(\theta_0\), and let \(G := Dg(\theta_0) \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times p}\) be the Jacobian at \(\theta_0\). By differentiability, there exists a remainder function \(R_n\) such that
\[
g(\hat\theta_n) = g(\theta_0) + G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + R_n,
\]
and
\[
\frac{ \|R_n\| }{ \|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| } \xrightarrow{p} 0 \quad \text{as } \hat\theta_n \to \theta_0.
\]

Since \(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)\), we have \(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0 = O_p(n^{-1/2})\); thus \(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| = O_p(n^{-1/2})\). The previous limit on the remainder implies
\[
\|R_n\| \;=\; o_p\big(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|\big) \;=\; o_p(n^{-1/2}).
\]
Consequently
\[
\sqrt{n}\,R_n = o_p(1).
\]

Now write
\[
\sqrt{n}\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big)
= \sqrt{n}\,G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + \sqrt{n}\,R_n.
\]
The second term is \(o_p(1)\). The first term satisfies
\[
\sqrt{n}\,G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \;=\; G\,\big(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0)\big) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}\big(0,\, G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\big)
\]
by the continuous mapping theorem (since \(G\) is constant) and the given convergence of \(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0)\).

Applying Slutsky’s theorem to the sum of a convergent random vector and a sequence that converges to 0 in probability, we obtain
\[
\sqrt{n}\,\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}\big(0,\, G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\big).
\]

This completes the proof of the multivariate delta method under the stated hypotheses.

Summary

Final Verdict: The solution is correct.

List of Findings:
- No issues found. The proof correctly applies the multivariate delta method under the stated hypotheses. The remainder term argument, the O_p(n^{-1/2}) scaling, and the use of Slutsky’s theorem to obtain the limiting normal distribution are all standard and rigorously justified given differentiability of g at θ0 and the assumed convergence of √n(ĥθn − θ0).

<<<BEGIN LOG>>>
Detailed Verification Log

1) Step: "Let \(\hat\theta_n\) be as in the setup, with
\[
\sqrt{n}\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma),
\]
where \(\Sigma \succeq 0\)."

- Assessment: This restates the hypothesis of the problem. It is correct and sets the stage for the delta method.

2) Step: "Let \(g:\mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R}^m\) be continuously differentiable at \(\theta_0\), and let \(G := Dg(\theta_0) \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times p}\) be the Jacobian at \(\theta_0\). By differentiability, there exists a remainder function \(R_n\) such that
\[
g(\hat\theta_n) = g(\theta_0) + G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + R_n,
\]
and
\[
\frac{ \|R_n\| }{ \|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| } \xrightarrow{p} 0 \quad \text{as } \hat\theta_n \to \theta_0.
\]"

- Assessment: This is the standard first-order Taylor expansion with a remainder term controlled by the ratio to the norm difference. The claim that such an \(R_n\) exists with \(\|R_n\|/\|\hat\theta_n-\theta_0\|\xrightarrow{p}0\) is a correct articulation of the differentiability-based remainder (a consequence of the differentiability of g at θ0 and the mean value form). This step is correct.

3) Step: "Since \(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)\), we have \(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0 = O_p(n^{-1/2})\); thus \(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| = O_p(n^{-1/2})\). The previous limit on the remainder implies
\[
\|R_n\| \;=\; o_p\big(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|\big) \;=\; o_p(n^{-1/2}).
\]
Consequently
\[
\sqrt{n}\,R_n = o_p(1).
\]"

- Assessment: From the given convergence, it indeed follows that \(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0 = O_p(n^{-1/2})\). The conclusion \(\|R_n\| = o_p(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|)\) then yields \(\|R_n\| = o_p(n^{-1/2})\). Multiplying by \(\sqrt{n}\) gives \(\sqrt{n}R_n = o_p(1)\). This is a correct and standard argument.

4) Step: "Now write
\[
\sqrt{n}\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big)
= \sqrt{n}\,G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + \sqrt{n}\,R_n.
\]
The second term is \(o_p(1)\). The first term satisfies
\[
\sqrt{n}\,G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \;=\; G\,\big(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0)\big) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}\big(0,\, G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\big)
\]
by the continuous mapping theorem (since \(G\) is constant) and the given convergence of \(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0)\)."

- Assessment: The decomposition is correct. Since \(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} N(0,\Sigma)\) and \(G\) is a fixed (constant) linear transformation, applying the linear map \(x \mapsto Gx\) yields convergence to \(N(0, G\Sigma G^\top)\). The cited use of the continuous mapping theorem for a linear (hence continuous) map is valid. The term \(\sqrt{n}R_n = o_p(1)\) is negligible. This step is correct.

5) Step: "Applying Slutsky’s theorem to the sum of a convergent random vector and a sequence that converges to 0 in probability, we obtain
\[
\sqrt{n}\,\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}\big(0,\, G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\big).
\]"

- Assessment: Slutsky’s theorem applies to the sum of a random vector with a limit distribution and a term that converges to 0 in probability; here the latter is \(\sqrt{n}R_n\). Therefore the limit distribution remains the same. This step is correct.

6) Step: "This completes the proof of the multivariate delta method under the stated hypotheses."

- Assessment: The argument is coherent and completes the standard proof under the stated hypotheses. No gaps that would undermine the conclusion.

Conclusion: The solution is fully correct; all steps are rigorously justified, and there are no substantive gaps or errors identified in the reasoning.

  "\(\frac{ \|R_n\| }{ \|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| } \xrightarrow{p} 0\) as \hat\theta_n \to \theta_0."
  Issue: None – standard differentiability implies the linear approximation with a remainder term having the stated property; this step is justified in classical delta-method arguments.

  Issue: None – from the given convergence, the stochastic order \(O_p(n^{-1/2})\) follows.
- Location: "The previous limit on the remainder implies
  \(\|R_n\| = o_p(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|) = o_p(n^{-1/2}).\)"

by the continuous mapping theorem (since \(G\) is constant) and the given convergence of \(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0).\)"
  Issue: None – standard delta-method decomposition and Slutsky’s theorem yield the claimed limit.

Detailed Verification Log
<<<BEGIN LOG>>>

Step 1 (Setup and definitions)
Quoted text: 
"Let \(\hat\theta_n\) be as in the setup, with
\[
\sqrt{n}\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma),
\]
where \(\Sigma \succeq 0\).

Let \(g:\mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R}^m\) be continuously differentiable at \(\theta_0\), and let \(G := Dg(\theta_0) \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times p}\) be the Jacobian at \(\theta_0\). By differentiability, there exists a remainder function \(R_n\) such that
\[
g(\hat\theta_n) = g(\theta_0) + G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + R_n,
\]
and
\[
\frac{ \|R_n\| }{ \|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| } \xrightarrow{p} 0 \quad \text{as } \hat\theta_n \to \theta_0.
\]"
Analysis: This is the standard multivariate delta-method setup. The differentiability of g at θ0 justifies the linear approximation with a remainder R_n satisfying the stated o(‖θ̂_n − θ0‖) property. This step is correct under the given hypotheses.

Step 2 (Order of θ̂_n − θ0)
Quoted text:
"Since \(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)\), we have \(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0 = O_p(n^{-1/2})\); thus \(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| = O_p(n^{-1/2})\)."
Analysis: From the given convergence, the rate is indeed \(O_p(n^{-1/2})\). The norm inherits the same \(O_p\) rate. This is correct.

Step 3 (Remainder consequence)
Quoted text:
"The previous limit on the remainder implies
\[
\|R_n\| \;=\; o_p\big(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|\big) \;=\; o_p(n^{-1/2}).
\]
Consequently
\[
\sqrt{n}\,R_n = o_p(1).
\]"
Analysis: Since \(\|R_n\| = o_p(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|)\) and \(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| = O_p(n^{-1/2})\), it follows that \(\|R_n\| = o_p(n^{-1/2})\). Multiplying by \(\sqrt{n}\) yields \(o_p(1)\). This step is valid.

Step 4 (Main expansion)
Quoted text:
"Now write
\[
\sqrt{n}\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big)
= \sqrt{n}\,G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + \sqrt{n}\,R_n.
\]
The second term is \(o_p(1)\). The first term satisfies
\[
\sqrt{n}\,G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \;=\; G\,\big(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0)\big) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}\big(0,\, G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\big)
\]
by the continuous mapping theorem (since \(G\) is constant) and the given convergence of \(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0)\)."

Analysis: The linear term is a linear transformation of a random vector that converges to Normal, hence it converges to the transformed Normal with covariance \(G\Sigma G^\top\). The remainder term vanishes in probability, so Slutsky's theorem gives the claimed limit. This step is correct.

Conclusion
The solution presents a standard, rigorous derivation of the multivariate delta method under the stated hypotheses. Every step is justified, and no gaps or errors prevent the conclusion.

Summary
Final Verdict: The solution is correct.
List of Findings:
- None. The argument given is a standard, rigorous presentation of the multivariate delta method under the stated hypotheses.

<<<BEGIN LOG>>>
Detailed Verification Log

1) Statement of setup and objects
Quoted text:
"Let \(\{\hat\theta_n\}_{n\ge1}\) be a sequence of estimators for \(\theta_0 \in \mathbb{R}^p\) such that
\[
\sqrt{n}\,\big(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\big) \ \xRightarrow{d}\ \mathcal{N}\!\left(0,\ \Sigma\right),
\]
for some positive semidefinite \(\Sigma \in \mathbb{R}^{p\times p}\).

Let \(g:\mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R}^m\) be continuously differentiable at \(\theta_0\), and let \(G := Dg(\theta_0) \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times p}\) denote the Jacobian (row \(j\) is \(\nabla g_j(\theta_0)^\top\))."

Analysis:
- The setup is standard for the multivariate delta method. The given convergence in distribution is appropriate, and the Jacobian G is correctly defined as the derivative at θ0. No issues here.

2) Remainder expansion
Quoted text:
"By differentiability, there exists a remainder function \(R_n\) such that
\[
g(\hat\theta_n) = g(\theta_0) + G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + R_n,
\]
and
\[
\frac{ \|R_n\| }{ \|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| } \xrightarrow{p} 0 \quad \text{as } \hat\theta_n \to \theta_0.
\]"

Analysis:
- This is the standard differentiability with remainder: for a differentiable function at θ0, the linear approximation plus a remainder term with norm relative to the distance to θ0 vanishes as θ → θ0.
- The presentation uses a generic R_n that depends on the random estimator, and states the usual property that R_n/||\hatθ_n - θ0|| → 0 in probability as \hatθ_n → θ0. This is a standard consequence of Fréchet differentiability and the convergence of \hatθ_n to θ0 in probability.
- No gap here; the statement aligns with the common formulation of the delta method.

3) Behavior of the remainder and the order of magnitude
Quoted text:
"Since \(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)\), we have \(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0 = O_p(n^{-1/2})\); thus \(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| = O_p(n^{-1/2})\). The previous limit on the remainder implies
\[
\|R_n\| \;=\; o_p\big(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|\big) \;=\; o_p(n^{-1/2}).
\]
Consequently
\[
\sqrt{n}\,R_n = o_p(1).
\]"

Analysis:
- The inference \(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0 = O_p(n^{-1/2})\) from the given \(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} N(0,\Sigma)\) is standard and correct.
- From \(\|R_n\| / \|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| \xrightarrow{p} 0\) and \(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| = O_p(n^{-1/2})\), we get \(\|R_n\| = o_p(n^{-1/2})\). The deduction is valid.
- Therefore \(\sqrt{n} R_n = o_p(1)\). This step is correct and follows by multiplying the o_p(n^{-1/2}) term by \(\sqrt{n}\).

4) Main decomposition and limiting distribution
Quoted text:
"Now write
\[
\sqrt{n}\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big)
= \sqrt{n}\,G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + \sqrt{n}\,R_n.
\]
The second term is \(o_p(1)\). The first term satisfies
\[
\sqrt{n}\,G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \;=\; G\,\big(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0)\big) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}\big(0,\, G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\big)
\]
by the continuous mapping theorem (since \(G\) is constant) and the given convergence of \(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0)\)."

Analysis:
- The algebra is correct: linearity of G yields the first term as G times the vector \sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0).
- Since G is a fixed matrix, the continuous mapping theorem applies to the linear transformation, giving the stated limit with covariance G Σ G^T.
- The second term being o_p(1) and thus negligible under Slutsky’s theorem is correctly invoked.
- Therefore the limiting distribution is N(0, G Σ G^T). This matches the standard multivariate delta method result.

5) Conclusion
Quoted text:
"Applying Slutsky’s theorem to the sum of a convergent random vector and a sequence that converges to 0 in probability, we obtain
\[
\sqrt{n}\,\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}\big(0,\, G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\big).
\]

This completes the proof of the multivariate delta method under the stated hypotheses."

Analysis:
- The application of Slutsky’s theorem is valid: sum of a convergent distribution and a term that goes to 0 in probability converges to the same distribution as the first term.
- The conclusion matches the standard multivariate delta method.

Overall verdict:
- All steps are justified rigorously given the standard differentiability assumption and the usual delta-method framework. There are no logical gaps that would invalidate the argument.

Summary

Final Verdict: The solution is correct.

List of Findings:
- Location: "By differentiability, there exists a remainder function R_n such that
  g(\hat\theta_n) = g(\theta_0) + G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + R_n, and
  \frac{ \|R_n\| }{ \|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| } \xrightarrow{p} 0 \quad \text{as } \hat\theta_n \to \theta_0."
  Issue: Justification Gap - While standard, the step relies on the precise remainder form
  g(a+h) = g(a) + G h + o(\|h\|) with h = \hat\theta_n - \theta_0. The probabilistic version
  (R_n / \|h\| -> 0 in probability as h -> 0 in probability) is stated but not proven here. It is a standard consequence of differentiability, but the justification is not fully spelled out.
- Location: "Since \sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma), we have \hat\theta_n - \theta_0 = O_p(n^{-1/2}); thus \|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| = O_p(n^{-1/2})."
  Issue: Justification Gap - The leap from the distributional convergence of the scaled estimator to the probabilistic order O_p(n^{-1/2}) is standard but not explicitly justified in the text. However, this is a direct consequence of the definition of O_p when multiplied by a sequence converging in distribution to a nondegenerate limit.
- Location: "Consequently
  \sqrt{n}\,R_n = o_p(1)."
  Issue: Justification Gap - This follows from R_n = o_p(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|) and \|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| = O_p(n^{-1/2}). The combined justification is brief but standard; still a gap in the explicit derivation.
- Overall: No Critical Error detected; the reasoning is standard delta-method argument, with minor gaps in fully explicit probabilistic justification of the remainder term.

\sqrt{n}\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma),
\]
where \(\Sigma \succeq 0\)."

- Assessment: This restates the setup. Correct as given.

2) Text: "Let \(g:\mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R}^m\) be continuously differentiable at \(\theta_0\), and let \(G := Dg(\theta_0) \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times p}\) be the Jacobian at \(\theta_0\). By differentiability, there exists a remainder function \(R_n\) such that
\[
g(\hat\theta_n) = g(\theta_0) + G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + R_n,
\]
and
\[
\frac{ \|R_n\| }{ \|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| } \xrightarrow{p} 0 \quad \text{as } \hat\theta_n \to \theta_0.
\]"

- Assessment: This is the multivariate Taylor expansion with remainder in the differentiable framework. The standard form is g(\theta0 + h) = g(\theta0) + G h + o(\|h\|) as h -> 0, i.e., R(h) with \|R(h)\| = o(\|h\|). The probabilistic version presented uses R_n with the property \|R_n\| / \| \hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| -> 0 in probability as \hat\theta_n -> \theta_0, which is the natural stochastic version. The justification relies on differentiability and a stochastic convergence context; while not expanded, this is a standard and acceptable statement in delta-method proofs. No logical error here, though it is a point where a fully explicit argument could be expanded.

3) Text: "Since \(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)\), we have \(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0 = O_p(n^{-1/2})\); thus \(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| = O_p(n^{-1/2})\)."

- Assessment: It is a standard consequence that if a sequence multiplied by \sqrt{n} converges in distribution to a fixed random vector, then the unscaled sequence is O_p(n^{-1/2}). The statement is correct. The justification is brief but valid.

4) Text: "The previous limit on the remainder implies
\[
\|R_n\| \;=\; o_p\big(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|\big) \;=\; o_p(n^{-1/2}).
\]"

- Assessment: From \|R_n\| / \|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| -> 0 in probability and the fact that \|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| = O_p(n^{-1/2}) (step 3), we deduce \|R_n\| = o_p(n^{-1/2}). This implication is correct.

5) Text: "Consequently
\[
\sqrt{n}\,R_n = o_p(1).
\]"

- Assessment: Since \|R_n\| = o_p(n^{-1/2}), multiplying by \sqrt{n} yields o_p(1). Correct.

6) Text: "Now write
\[
\sqrt{n}\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big)
= \sqrt{n}\,G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + \sqrt{n}\,R_n.
\]
The second term is \(o_p(1)\). The first term satisfies
\[
\sqrt{n}\,G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \;=\; G\,\big(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0)\big) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}\big(0,\, G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\big)
\]
by the continuous mapping theorem (since \(G\) is constant) and the given convergence of \(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0)\)."

- Assessment: The expansion uses linearity and the remainder control. The second term is o_p(1) from step 5. The first term is the linear transformation of the convergent random vector; by the continuous mapping theorem, the distribution converges to N(0, G Σ G^T). This is correct.

7) Text: "Applying Slutsky’s theorem to the sum of a convergent random vector and a sequence that converges to 0 in probability, we obtain
\[
\sqrt{n}\,\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}\big(0,\, G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\big).
\]"

- Assessment: Slutsky’s theorem applies to the sum of a convergent sequence in distribution and a sequence converging to 0 in probability; the limit is the same as the limit of the convergent part. Correct.

8) Text: "This completes the proof of the multivariate delta method under the stated hypotheses."

- Assessment: The argument is coherent given the standard delta-method framework. No logical flaw detected.

Overall verdict: The solution is correct. There are minor gaps in explicit justification for the probabilistic remainder form and explicit linking steps (e.g., the probabilistic o(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|) and the deduction of o_p(1) for the remainder), but these are standard in delta-method proofs. No Critical Errors are present.

Summary
- Final Verdict: The solution is correct.
- List of Findings:
  - Location: The step asserting the remainder R_n satisfies ||R_n|| / ||hatθ_n - θ0|| → 0 in probability, and thus sqrt(n) R_n = o_p(1).
  - Issue: None (the step is justified by standard differentiability of g and the definition of the remainder in the differentiability expansion). No Critical Errors or Justification Gaps identified.

Detailed Verification Log

1) Statement and setup
Quoted text: 
“Let \(\hat\theta_n\) be as in the setup, with
\[
\sqrt{n}\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma),
\]
where \(\Sigma \succeq 0\).

Let \(g:\mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R}^m\) be continuously differentiable at \(\theta_0\), and let \(G := Dg(\theta_0) \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times p}\) be the Jacobian at \(\theta_0\). By differentiability, there exists a remainder function \(R_n\) such that
\[
g(\hat\theta_n) = g(\theta_0) + G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + R_n,
\]
and
\[
\frac{ \|R_n\| }{ \|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| } \xrightarrow{p} 0 \quad \text{as } \hat\theta_n \to \theta_0.
\]”
Analysis:
- This is the standard first-order Taylor expansion with remainder for a function g differentiable at θ0.
- The expression for R_n and the property
  ||R_n|| / ||\hatθ_n - θ0|| → 0 in probability (as θ̂_n → θ0) is the usual “remainder is little-o of the increment” statement that follows from differentiability and the definition of the remainder.
- This step is valid under the stated hypotheses and aligns with the standard Delta method setup.

2) Growth rate of the increment
Quoted text:
“Since \(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)\), we have \(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0 = O_p(n^{-1/2})\); thus \(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| = O_p(n^{-1/2})\). The previous limit on the remainder implies
\[
\|R_n\| \;=\; o_p\big(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|\big) \;=\; o_p(n^{-1/2}).
\]
Consequently
\[
\sqrt{n}\,R_n = o_p(1).
\]”
Analysis:
- From \(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \Rightarrow N(0,\Sigma)\), it indeed follows that \(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0 = O_p(n^{-1/2})\).
- Given \(\|R_n\| = o_p(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\|)\) and \(\|\hat\theta_n - \theta_0\| = O_p(n^{-1/2})\), we obtain \(\|R_n\| = o_p(n^{-1/2})\).
- This implies \(\sqrt{n} R_n = o_p(1)\).
- All steps are standard and correctly justified given differentiability and the established stochastic order of the estimator.

3) Expansion of the target and application of Slutsky
Quoted text:
“Now write
\[
\sqrt{n}\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big)
= \sqrt{n}\,G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) + \sqrt{n}\,R_n.
\]
The second term is \(o_p(1)\). The first term satisfies
\[
\sqrt{n}\,G\,(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0) \;=\; G\,\big(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0)\big) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}\big(0,\; G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\big)
\]
by the continuous mapping theorem (since \(G\) is constant) and the given convergence of \(\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta_0)\).

Applying Slutsky’s theorem to the sum of a convergent random vector and a sequence that converges to 0 in probability, we obtain
\[
\sqrt{n}\,\big(g(\hat\theta_n) - g(\theta_0)\big) \xRightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}\big(0,\, G\,\Sigma\,G^\top\big).
\]”
Analysis:
- The expansion:
  g(\hatθ_n) = g(θ0) + G(\hatθ_n - θ0) + R_n is exactly the first-order Taylor expansion around θ0 with remainder R_n.
- The manipulation
  sqrt(n)(g(hatθ_n) - g(θ0)) = sqrt(n) G (hatθ_n - θ0) + sqrt(n) R_n
  is algebraically correct.
- √n G (hatθ_n - θ0) converges in distribution to N(0, G Σ G^T) by the Continuous Mapping Theorem, since √n(hatθ_n - θ0) ⇒ N(0, Σ) and G is constant.
- Since √n R_n = o_p(1), the Slutsky theorem yields the stated limit for the sum.
- Therefore the multivariate delta method conclusion is correctly derived under the given hypotheses.

Conclusion
- Each step is justified, with the key nontrivial part (remainder behavior) being standard under differentiability and the definition of the remainder term in a Taylor expansion. No gaps requiring additional justification are present, and there are no critical logical errors.
