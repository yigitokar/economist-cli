# Research Brief: Test Request

**Objective**: Validate the Deep Research workflow runs end-to-end.

**Context**: This is a test request to observe the Deep Research process. The results themselves are secondary to validating the workflow.

**Constraints**: No specific constraints.

**Sources**: General web search.

**Deliverables**: A short summary report (a few paragraphs) on the topic "summary of recent research on productivity growth".

**Time Limit**: A quick run to see the process, without a specific deadline.

**Success Criteria**: Successful execution of the `deep_literature_review` tool and generation of a report.
