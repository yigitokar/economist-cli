# Research Brief: The Impact of Minimum Wage on Employment (Test)

## Objective
Execute a test run of the deep research process to produce a concise summary of the economic literature on the impact of minimum wage on employment.

## Context
This is a test request to validate the deep research workflow. The topic is a classic, well-studied area in labor economics, making it suitable for evaluating the tool's ability to synthesize foundational and recent findings.

## Constraints
- The analysis should touch upon both foundational papers and more recent evidence.
- The output should be a high-level summary rather than a comprehensive meta-analysis.

## Sources
- Prioritize a mix of seminal papers (e.g., Card & Krueger) and recent, high-quality meta-analyses or review articles from top economics journals or institutions like NBER.

## Deliverables
- A 2-3 paragraph summary of the main findings and points of debate in the literature.
- A list of 3-5 key papers (foundational or recent) that are central to this topic.

## Time Limit
- Include seminal works and research from the last 10-15 years to capture the evolution of the consensus.

## Success Criteria
- The process completes successfully.
- The final report is well-structured, accurately reflects the general state of the literature, and provides the specified deliverables.
