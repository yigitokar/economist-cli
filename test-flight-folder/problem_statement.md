Theorem (Existence of Walrasian Equilibrium under Convex Preferences)

In an exchange economy with a finite number of consumers and goods:

Each consumer has a continuous, convex, and locally non-satiated preference relation.

Each consumer has a strictly positive endowment.

Then there exists a Walrasian (competitive) equilibrium: a price vector

) such that every consumer maximizes their utility given prices and budget, and markets clear (aggregate demand = aggregate supply).
